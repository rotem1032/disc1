    So you're interested in implementing PEEKY to your Discord server? Awesome!
    <br>
    <br>
    The first thing you wanna do is to add PEEKY to your server with all the wanted permissions, so that you minimize the amount of problems that you and the bot that would come later on.
    <br>
    You can invite PEEKY by going to the home page, then you just select an arbitrary server from the list and PEEKY will be there in no time!
    <br>
    <br>
    Now that PEEKY is in your server, there's alot of stuff that he can do, but right now we'll just focus on functions.
    <br>
    Functions are something that PEEKY uses to enhance your server, stuff like Welcome Messages and even Role savers.
    <br>
    You can find the list of all the available functions in the Functions page.
    <br>
    <br>
    After you find a function that you'd like PEEKY to use, simply use the Toggle and Set commands.
    <br>
    The Toggle command switches a function's state between enabled and disabled, but the Set command will change the function's setting.
    <br>
    For example, with the Welcome Messages function, we can use the Set command to change the channel that the function will send messages to, and then enable the function with the Toggle command.
    <br>
    <br>
    If you wanna see all the enabled functions and their settings, you can use the Overview command.
    <br>
    List of all the commands can be found in the Commands page.
    <br>
    <br>
    Any further questions? Come and join the Support Server or consider using the server template!

<div class="inlinediv" id="musicmodes">

    <div class="tutorial_item">

    PEEKY has a small selection of so called Music Modes, which can be changed through the Music Menu.
    <br>
    In this tutorial you will learn what each of them can do and then you can choose your favorite!
    <br>
    <br>
    The Normal music mode will delete any songs from the queue one they end or are skipped.
    <br>
    <br>
    The Looping music mode will put the songs that end or are skipped to the end of the queue.
    <br>
    To remove a song from the queue while this music mode is active, you can use the Skip command to skip the song while its not playing.
    <br>
    <br>
    The Automated music mode will add a random song to the queue everytime a song ends, best used if you just want to listen to some music and not bother with having to add any.
    <br>
    It is not possible to add any songs to the queue while this mode is on.

    <div class="tutorial_item">

    This is a tutorial on how to to purchase and equip a background for your profile.
    <br>
    <br>
    If you want to see all of the backgrounds that you can put on your profile, they are all displayed in the Backgrounds page.
    <br>
    Be sure to go there and see what background suits your profile the best!
    <br>
    <br>
    After you find a fitting background, be sure to copy the attached command and paste it in Discord to see all the possible commands.
    <br>
    From the list you should focus on two commands called BuyBackground and SetBackground.
    <br>
    The BuyBackground will add the background to your inventory for a price and the SetBackground command will then set it on your profile.

<div class="inlinediv" id="ambassadorprogram">

    <div class="tutorial_item">

    The Ambassador Program is a linear progression system, which kind of resembles the likes of a Battle Pass, except all the rewards can be obtained for free.
    <br>
    The way you make some progress in the Ambassador Program is by increasing your score, which you can view in your inventory and increase for free by inviting your friends to the Support Server, or by paying a small fee.
    <br>
    <br>
    How to increase your score for free:
    <br>
    <code>
    1. Go to the #home channel inside the Support Server. <br>
    2. Create a permanent link connected to the channel. <br>
    3. Send it to your friends and wait for them to join. <br>
    4. If everything works, you should get a DM from PEEKY. <br><br>
    (Be sure to tell your friend that they'll receive the Receiver badge as a bonus!)
    </code>
    <br>
    <br>
    How to increase your score by paying:
    <br>
    <code>
    1. Go to the Store page and find the "Ambasador Skips" item. <br>
    2. Click the purchase button, after which you want to complete the transaction. <br>
    3. If the transaction was accepted and everything works out, you should get a DM from PEEKY.

<a class="item_header" onclick="ToggleCategory('workshop');" href="#workshop"><font size="5">Workshop</font></a> <br><br>
<div class="inlinediv" id="workshop">

    <div class="tutorial_item">

    Workshop is a channel in the Support Server that allows you to submit your images to PEEKY's background gallery.
    <br>
    <br>
    When uploading a background, you should also keeep in mind that racist or NSFW images are strongly forbidden and could get you blocked from the Workshop.
    <br>
    This is the format that you wanna use, otherwise the submission will be automatically removed.
    <br>
    <code>
    Name: [text] <br>
    Credit: [text]  <br>
    Price: [number]
    </code>
    <br>
    <br>
    If you're submitting your own work, you are eligible for your background to have Background Revenue enabled, which means that you will get Gredit for everytime the backgrounds gets bought.
    <br>
    You can see that your background has revenue enabled when it says "revenue enabled" in the Background list.
    <br>
    <br>
    You may have also noticed that there are exclusive backgrounds.
    <br>
    Exclusive Backgrounds are usually given out through events and can be only added by PEEKY's developers.
